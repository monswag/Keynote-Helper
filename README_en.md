# Keynote-Helper

[中文](README.md) | English

There are some tips I grasped when using Keynote, which include layout, objects and animation. You can merge the file into your project, I'm planning to make a full instruction for objects and animation later. I hope this project could help you find it easier with Keynote.

## Example
#### Layout
<img src="images/layout-grid.png" alt="Grid from table" width="600">
Build varied slices with simple layout rules.

#### Object
<img src="images/object-vector-image.png" alt="Use vector file in keynote" width="600">
Master your skill to play with object in Keynote.

#### Animation
<img src="images/animation-with-color.png" alt="Apply animation with color" width="600">
Including handy animation applying tips and templates that help you with content expression.
